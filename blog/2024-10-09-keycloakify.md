Phase Two has long been big fans of [Keycloakify](https://www.keycloakify.dev/). The work being done by [Joseph Garrone](https://github.com/garronej) is in our opinion some of the best user-focused work in the Keycloak community. Keycloakify brings the ability to theme the Keycloak frontend applications: Login, Account, Admin(coming) using modern toolsets like React or Angular and theming systems like Tailwind or Material-UI. Keycloakify allows you to build quickly and deploy themes to your Keycloak installation in a manner that the existing Keycloak toolset (ftl templates) does not.

Many of Phase Two customers use Keycloakify and because we value it as an important piece of the Keycloak community, Phase Two has officially entered into a sponsorship agreement with Keycloakify.

To make using our [extensions](https://github.com/p2-inc#our-extensions-) easier with Keycloakify, we've started with porting our [Magic Link](https://phasetwo.io/blog/set-up-magic-links/) [extension](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-magic-link) to Keycloakify templates. At present, those templates can be found in Phase Two's forked [Keycloakify Starter](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloakify-starter/tree/p2/magic-link-extension-templates/src/login/pages). We are actively working on adding them to the main line of templates which can be customized directly from the Keycloakify CLI.

We've also joined the Keycloakify [Discord](https://discord.gg/mJdYJSdcm4) for quick and direct communication.
